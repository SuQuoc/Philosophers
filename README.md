The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classical synchronization problem in computer science, which illustrates synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. In this problem, there are multiple processes (philosophers) that share a limited set of resources (forks) to perform a task (eating). The challenge is to design a concurrent algorithm that allows each philosopher to access the resources they need without causing deadlock or starvation.

When using mutex locks to solve the Dining Philosophers Problem, the key is to ensure that philosophers can only access the forks they need, one at a time, and release them when they are done eating codereview.stackexchange.com. Here's a possible solution using mutex locks:

1. Each philosopher is represented by a thread, and each fork is represented by a mutex.
2. A philosopher must lock the mutex for the fork to their left and the mutex for the fork to their right before they can begin eating.
3. If a philosopher cannot lock both mutexes, they must wait until they become available.
4. After eating, a philosopher must unlock both mutexes, allowing other philosophers to access the forks.

However, there are still some challenges when coding the Dining Philosophers Problem with mutex locks:

1. Deadlock: If all philosophers pick up their left forks at the same time, none of them can pick up their right forks, causing a deadlock geeksforgeeks.org.
2. Starvation: If neighboring philosophers keep eating and releasing forks before a philosopher can acquire both forks, the philosopher may starve codereview.stackexchange.com.
3. Thread-start pattern: If threads are started in a loop and immediately try to acquire forks before other philosophers are initialized, the problem becomes trivialized codereview.stackexchange.com.

To address these challenges, you can use various techniques such as limiting the number of philosophers entering the room, implementing a priority system, or using a different synchronization mechanism like semaphores (not allowed in this project subject) or condition variables.
