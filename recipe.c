State Change
printf("timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork")

printf("timestamp_in_ms X is eating");
printf("timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping");
printf("timestamp_in_ms X is thinking");
printf("timestamp_in_ms X died");



creating threads 
each thread is a philo and does philo things

when do they die?
    should a thread only return if they die? 
    if (timestamp after eating )
